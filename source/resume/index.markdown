I've worked on both onsite and remote engagements, aligning technology with
business requirements and providing knowledge transfer to the
customer based on specific customer goals and performance
expectations. I've written custom SELinux policies and
migrated both Unix and Windows systems to RHEL, including
script conversion and cross-training administrators on Linux
administration. My experience includes but is not limited to SAN
and NAS attachment, NIS, performance and capacity management,
Kerberos, LDAP, and architectural design.

Aside from my [Github repos](https://github.com/jumanjiman),
I've [contributed to tito](https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito/commits/master?author=jumanjiman) and
[contributed to etckeeper](http://git.kitenet.net/?p=etckeeper.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=jumanjiman).
